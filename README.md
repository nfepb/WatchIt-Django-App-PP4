# **WatchIt! - Project Portfolio 4**

![WatchIt Website Responsive Mockup](docs/images/watchit-website-mockup.png)

# **Introduction**

Welcome to WatchIt!,

WatchiIt is my fourth portfolio project that I have been working on in the Full Stack Developer Programme, as a student of the Code Institute. 

The purpose of this project was a build a full-stack website based around a business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. The main technologies used for this project are HTML, CSS, Python, and Django. Heroku Postgres is used as a relational database.

WatchIt! is a website for reviewing movies and searching for new movies to watch. Anyone that enjoys watching a movie can look up movies they think are interesting. They can read on other website's user thoughts of the said movie and how they rate it. WatchIt! also allows logged in users to add movies to their watchlist and publish reviews on movies they have watched. 

WhatchIt! is a fictional brand. This project is for educational purposes only.

# **User Experience Design - UXD** 

A large part of the inspiration behind the planning for this project came from Jason James Garretts‚Äôs, ‚ÄúThe Elements of User-Experience‚Äù.

By keeping the user in mind throughout the design and development of the project, it would be easier to make the user experience a satisfying and cohesive.

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes,

* [The Strategy Plane](#the-strategy-pane)
* [The Scope Plane](#the-scope-plane)
* [The Structure Plane](#the-structure-plane)
* [The Skeleton Plane](#the-skeleton-plane)
* [The Surface Plane](#the-surface-plane)

# **The Strategy Pane**

##¬†**App Creator's Goals**

* To provide the users a website where they can view movie listings, see how other rate the movie, and read other user's review of the movie.
* To allow users to create, update and delete reviews.
* To allow users to submit new movies for other users to discover and/or review.
* To allow the admin user to approve, update and delete movie listings from the frontend.
* To provide users with clear and adequate responses based on their input or actions.

## User Stories

To help in defining the most important benefits of the app and the features required to deliver this value, I created a flowchat that goes through the different stages of the app user. It starts with the visitor (as the user), and evolves into a connected user, which is also identified as a regular user. 

[User Flowchart](./planning-docs/user-stories/images/user-flowchart.png)

### **Admin User Stories**

### **Site User Stories**

### **Logged-In User Stories**

My user stories were obtained by doing research into other apps/websites and analyzing how the user was accompanied through their journey. The [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) and [AlloCin√©](https://www.allocine.fr/) helped me define what were some of the critical features to get to a MVP, and which features were considered 'nice to have' for later development.

# **The Scope Plane**

## **Agile methodology**

The principles of the Agile Methodology framed how this project was tackled. The project was initially started on another repository of GitHub - <a href="https://github.com/nfepb/WatchIt-Django-App-PP4">PP4-Django-Full-Stack</a>. However, due to server issues, I was advised by my mentor to start over for risk of not submitting the project in time. For more flexibility, the Kanban board was implemented through [Quip](https://salesforce.quip.com/). For centralisation of the assets, the Kanban Board was later re-created in this repository. <a href="https://github.com/users/nfepb/projects/4/views/1">WatchIt Kanban Board</a>

The project issues were divived into a 3 different sections:
* üìö Backlog
* üöß In Progress
* ‚úÖ Done

![Kanban board Watchit]()

Github issues were used to create the User Stories and to keep track of bugs identified during this project. Each User Story and Bug had a clear title, acceptance criteria and smaller tasks (if adequate). 

Milestones were added to keep track of the different Iterations. There were 3 separate Iterations. User Stories were completed based on the Iteration that was in progress. Not every User Story in each Iteration was delivered in time. Too many ideas, not enought time. Too much ambition for the defined deadline. This is the reason why I opted for a phased approach to help digest and define what I would work on in an initial deployment, and what would come in the later stage. After each Sprint in each Iteration, the User Stories that I could not deliver on were re-evaluated to define if they were "must-haves" in the following Iteration. 

## **User Stories**

**Phase 1**
- As a user, I can easily understand the purpose of this website on the homepage, so that I can easily understand the value proposition.
- As a user, I can easily navigate through the website, so that I can access the pages that I relevant for my usage.
- As a user, I can browse a list of movies, so that I can discover newly added movies easily.
- As a user, I can browse a list of movie genres, so that I can discover reviewed movies in a genre I am interested in.
- As a user, I can read more information about a movie in which I am interested in, so that I can judge if I am interested in this movie.
- As a user, I can read other people's review of the movie, so that I can read other people's thoughts of the movie. 
- As a user, I can write a review for a movie, so that so that I can share my opinion and rating of the movie. 
- As a user, I can create a personal account, so that so that I can review movies I have watched and save movies to my watchlist.
- As a user, I can add a movie, so that I can share my opinion on movies that are not being reviewed yet or new add movies to my watchlist.
- As a user, I can add a movie to a genre, so that the movie can be easily discovered by other users and potentially discover new movies in the same genre.
- As an admin, I can create a new movie entry, so that users can review the movie that does not yet exist on the website.
- As an admin, I can create a new genre entry, so that users can link movies to a genre and discover movies associated to this genre.
- As an admin, I can approve or decline new movie additions created by users, so that I can keep a clear database.

**Phase 2**
- As a user, I can add movies to my watchlist, so that I can keep track of the movies that I wish to watch in the future.
- As a user, I can see the list of movies I added to my watchlist, so that I can keep track of movies I find interesting.
- As a user, I can see the list of reviews I posted, so that I can keep track of my thoughts on the movies I reviewed.
- As a user, I can rate the movies I have watched, to guide other users to the movies I think are worth watching and discover good movies.
- As a user, I can search through the website, so that I easily find a specific movie I am interested in.
- As a user, I can update or delete a posted review, so that I can control my posted content.

**Phase 3**
- As an admin, I can validate or delete new movie listings to be approved through the site, so that my role is made easier.
- ~~As an admin, I can update movies already approved, so that the information on the site is correct.~~ [not delivered]
- ~~As a user, I can search for a movie from any page of the website, so that my navigation is even more easy.~~ [not delivered]
- ~~As a user, I can see which movies are the highest rated, so that I can benefit from other user input.~~ [not delivered]

# **The Structure Plane**

5 pages are visible from the navigation bar. The genre_details page is accessible from the home page or from the book_detail page. The submit a movie form-page is only accessible when submitting a movie to the database.

The Homepage, Moviebox, Login, Signup and Contact pages can be accessed by all users. Once a user logs in or signs in they have access to the My Watchlist page. The Sign up & Login pages are removed from the navigation after the user logs in. Also, the log in page is changed to a log out page.

## **Color Palette**

![Color pallete used throughout the project](docs/images/watchit-color-palette.png)

The main colors, being #bde1e1e & #0000000 are associated with movie theaters and a famous streaming service brand. 

The color #ede7d9 is used in contrast to the 2 previous colour to help text stand out, without being too aggressive on the eyes. The color is close to the one of popcorn, which has a strong association with the entertainment industry as well.

The color #d98324 was used mainly for links and spans in order to make information stand out versus the lighter text color on the different pages.

## **Fonts**

'Poppins' is the only font family that is used throughout the website. It is a 'smooth' writing style with several font-weights, which offers a lot of diversity in the use, without having to pick another font-family for the different use through the website. It bring unity to the user experience on the different pages.

## **Images**

## **Database Design**

SQLite was used throughout the development of the WatchIt! app. During deployment to a production environment, Heroku PostgreSQL was used.

In order to support the functionalities defined in the user stories for each Epic, mapping the architecture became crucial. This helped foresee how we could get to an MVP.

### **Key Models**

[Database Diagram](docs/schema/watchit-database-diagram.png)

**User**

* The User is created based on the User model, which is created by Allauth on registration.

**Movie**

* The Movie holds information about each movie entry in the database. Each product has a unique ID.
* The Movie model is connected to the WatchlistItem model. This allows the user to add multiple movies to a single watchlist. 

**Review**

* Reviews can be posted by the users on the movies with this model
* The Review model has a one-to-many relationship to the User model to obtain the username. One user can post multiple reviews. 
* The Review model also is linked to the Movie model based on a one-to-many relationship. This allows one movie to have multiple reviews. 

**WatchListItem**

* The WatchListItem is used to allow the many-to-many relationship between the users and the movies. 
* One user can have multiple movies in their watchlist through the movie lookup in the Movie model. 
* One movie can be added to multiple users' watchlist through the user ID in the User model.
